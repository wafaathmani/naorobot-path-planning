In the figure the robot is in coordinate with blue color and the destination in
the coordinate with green color so in order to find the best way to go to that point
we notice when dropping the robot coordinate on the x and y parameter and then
connect it with destination coordinate an right triangle formed ,Now based on the
relationship between the robot point and the destination point will fix the robot
direction without forgetting that the robot in the beginning is faced to the left with
90° from the previous part what left is correcting the angle calculate the steps , with
using phytagels formular 
to find hypotenuse value witch represent
the number of steps and calculate the angle of it tan∅
and we get the turning angle for the robot , now after getting the angle and the number od
steps nao will walk to the destination point
